Challange_number_2



*Stock Market Analysis*


This VBA script is designed to analyze stock market data within an Excel workbook. It iterates through each worksheet in the workbook, calculates various metrics for each stock, and presents the findings in a summary table.


Beginning with identifying the first unique ticker name in the dataset, the script calculates both yearly and percentage changes for every ticker, alongside aggregating total stock volumes. Additionally, it constructs a specialized table highlighting stocks with the greatest percent increase, percent decrease, and total volume, providing valuable insights into market performance.




For this challenge, I used the “Credit_Card” assignment code and other code formats from Xpert Learning Assistant and Stack Overflow and chatGpt
